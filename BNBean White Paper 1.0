1. Introduction

1.1 Background

The cryptocurrency market has witnessed the rise of meme coins, captivating the community with their humorous themes and potential for financial gains. BNBean draws inspiration from the beloved legume and the timeless antics of Mr. Bean to create a distinctive meme coin experience. By harnessing the capabilities of the Binance Smart Chain, BNBean provides a platform for bean enthusiasts and crypto aficionados to come together, enjoy themselves, and reap the associated rewards.

1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of BNBean are as follows:

- Embrace the love for beans: BNBean celebrates the universal joy and fascination surrounding beans. Through strategic branding, targeted marketing initiatives, and community-focused programs, BNBean aims to create an engaging and inclusive environment that resonates with bean enthusiasts worldwide.

- Reflect rewards to holders: BNBean incorporates a unique reflection mechanism that automatically redistributes 1% of each transaction volume back to its holders. This mechanism incentivizes long-term holding and encourages active participation within the community.

- Foster community governance: BNBean firmly believes in the power of community governance. Holders are granted the opportunity to actively shape the trajectory of BNBean by participating in voting and decision-making processes, ensuring a truly decentralized and democratic ecosystem.

- Drive ongoing marketing efforts: BNBean recognizes the importance of continuous marketing to raise awareness, drive adoption, and foster sustained growth. By allocating funds from the reflection mechanism, BNBean ensures a dedicated budget for marketing initiatives, aiming to attract new holders and promote the project across various platforms.

2. Tokenomics

2.1 Token Distribution

BNBean has a maximum token supply of 21T tokens. The initial distribution will adhere to the following structure:

- Presale: 30% of the total token supply will be made available during the presale phase, ensuring a fair and wide distribution among early adopters.

- Liquidity: 55% of the tokens will be securely locked as liquidity on the PancakeSwap platform, fostering stability and providing a readily accessible trading pair for convenient BNBean token transactions.

- Marketing/CEX and Development: 15% of the tokens will be allocated to a dedicated marketing and development fund, facilitating ongoing marketing campaigns, community initiatives, and project development.

2.2 Reflection Mechanism

BNBean incorporates an exceptional reflection mechanism that automatically redistributes 1% of each transaction volume back to its holders. This distinctive feature encourages long-term holding and fosters active participation within the community. 

Notably, we want to emphasize that our LP wallet, which constitutes a significant portion of 55%, has been excluded from this redistribution process. By excluding the LP wallet, we ensure that rewards are exclusively directed towards our dedicated holders, allowing for a fair and equitable distribution of benefits.

This deliberate decision reflects our commitment to prioritizing the interests of our loyal community members. We aim to create a sustainable ecosystem where active participation is rewarded and where the interests of our holders are paramount.

Join BNBean today and become part of our thriving community, where your commitment is recognized and your investment is valued. Together, let's grow and prosper in an environment that fosters long-term success for all.


3. Community Governance

BNBean firmly believes that the strength of any project lies in the collective wisdom and participation of its community. To achieve a decentralized and community-driven ecosystem, BNBean implements a governance model that empowers holders to actively participate in decision-making processes.

Through voting mechanisms, holders can propose and vote on various project initiatives, such as marketing campaigns, partnerships, charity donations,and other relevant matters. This democratic approach ensures that the interests and preferences of the community are well-represented, fostering a sense of ownership and pride among BNBean holders.

4. Ongoing Marketing Efforts

BNBean recognizes that continuous marketing efforts are crucial for increasing visibility, attracting new holders, and fostering sustainable growth. By allocating a portion of the reflection rewards, BNBean establishes a dedicated budget for ongoing marketing campaigns across diverse platforms, including social media channels, influencer collaborations, and strategic partnerships.
